Description: In this study, we applied differential gene expression, functional enrichment, network topology, and machine learning (ML) approaches. A central hub of RNA processing proteins, including EIF4A3 and DDX39B, was identified within the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, showing high information flow capacity due to its sparse, interconnected structure. EIF4A3 was further explored using structure- and ligand-based drug design. Robust QSAR-ML models were developed for virtual screening of small molecules targeting TB and HIV. Top candidates, F308-0950 and F3222-1416, were identified through molecular docking and refined via a novel QSAR clustering methodology. Predicted metabolic pathways indicated glucuronidation and oxidative ether cleavage, with potential side effects like convulsions, nausea, and dizziness. These findings suggest promising drug candidates but emphasize the need for further animal testing to assess safety and efficacy.
